# Welcome to my Portfolio Page!
This is a repository with the code to my portfolio page, https://njuddportfolio.com.

## What Is Here?
This is a web application written with **React.js (Rsbuild) and TypeScript**, using **Hono** in the backend for the API.

All of the deploy code is here, as well! This uses **terraform IaC** and **Azure DevOps Pipelines**. I have experience in CI/CD and wanted to showcase an implementation here. The deployment.yml files are pipelines in an Azure DevOps project.
They run automatically when pertinent code is merged to this repository's **main** branch.

Take a look around! I am certainly not a UI/UX designer but I have several years of experience in javascript frameworks, web development and APIs. I have nearly 2 years of experience in the DevOps space, as well.
